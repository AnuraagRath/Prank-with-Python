# Prank-with-Python
Prank people by sending them these Python programs.

* RickRolling

When the first Program is initiated, Multiple Browser windows will open one after the other, which plays 'Never Gonna Give you up' and you will be in a Rickroll Loop forever, unless you terminate the program

* Random Mousemovement (Haunted Computer)

When the second program is initiated, a Small window will appear notifying that Some Updates have been done.

When you terminate the program, either by closing the window or by clicking 'ok', The Mouse pointer will start moving randomly all across the screen and can be stopped only when you terminate the program from the TERMINAL

Hope You had Some Fun

Yours Truely,
